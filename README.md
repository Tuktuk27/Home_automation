# Embedded Linux System Project with Raspberry Pi for a Home automation system

# Abstract

This project aims to create a special system using Linux on a simulated Raspberry Pi. Our main goals are to make a home automation center, a simple web-based control for smart devices, and ensure good security. We use the popular Raspberry Pi and the flexible Linux system to meet the growing demand for home automation. 

We started by trying to copy the Raspberry Pi setup using QEMU and experimenting with a headless Raspberry Pi. Then, we set up the system, made drivers for controlling a lamp and temperature, and configured how the system starts up. 

For security, we explored using VNC and SSH tunneling. We also created a user-friendly interface with Tkinter for controlling lamps and thermostats. We simulated devices like lamps and temperature controllers using Flask. 

We faced challenges, like trouble compiling kernel modules and dealing with QEMU software complexity. But these challenges helped us learn. 

Looking ahead, we plan to improve error handling, enhance the interface, strengthen security, and explore more features. The project offers insights into working with embedded systems and user-friendly technology in the context of home automation.

# II. Project overview and results
The "Embedded Linux System Project with Raspberry Pi" unfolds through distinct steps, each contributing to the development and functionality of the home automation system.
Simulating the Raspberry Pi Environment:
-	Attempted emulation using QEMU, with a focus on understanding the challenges and limitations.
-	Explored the concept of a headless Raspberry Pi for streamlined operation (using VNC on boot loader: “vncserver :1 -geometry 1280x720 -depth 16”
-	Finally, use of Oracle VM with a desktop Linux image to simplify the implementation

</p>

Environment Setup and System Configuration:
-	Installed and configured a Ubuntu virtual machine to facilitate Raspberry Pi emulation.
-	Developed user-space device drivers for lamp and temperature control.
-	Configured the boot loader and enabled auto-login for a seamless startup: “sudo raspi-config” and “.bashrc“ modification (as said above, to launch on start up the VNC server, but also the GUI).
Network Configuration and Security Implementation:
-	Examined VNC versus web-based interface for remote communication: basically, Resource Usage vs limited graphic  VNC chosen for simplicity and GUI performance since resource usage isn’t critical in a home automation system.
-	Network security solutions to consider: Firewall Configuration, Strong Authentication, for remote access might need to use secure methods such as VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) for encrypted and authenticated remote connections.
-	Communication “historic” on terminal:

GUI Development:
-	Utilized Tkinter for creating a user-friendly graphical interface.
-	Implemented features for lamp and thermostat control, customizable background images, and real-time temperature display.
